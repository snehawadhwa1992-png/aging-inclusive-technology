## 📖 Overview

This project presents comprehensive research findings on designing technology for older adults, moving beyond ageist stereotypes and deficit-focused approaches. The interactive interface allows users to explore five key design principles and their practical applications.

## 🎯 The Five Design Principles

1. **Learning Infrastructure, Not Just Product Features**
   - Identity-affirming design
   - Low-stakes practice and gamification
   - Cognitive-friendly interaction layers
   - Coherent ecosystems with frictionless navigation
   - Trust-building through transparency

2. **Agency and Autonomy, Not Monitoring and Control**
   - Self-directed, empowering experiences
   - Seniors as primary users
   - Connection to purpose and identity
   - Co-design with senior adults

3. **Holistic Wellbeing, Not Just Physical Health**
   - Four domains of wellbeing (physical, cognitive, social, purpose)
   - Socially-connected aging
   - Cultural, economic, and contextual accessibility

4. **Meaningful Engagement, Not Just Time-Filling**
   - Intrinsic motivation and wellbeing
   - Value over engagement metrics
   - User-controlled experiences

5. **Adaptation, Personalization, and Accessible Interfaces**
   - Design for adaptation, not perfection
   - Multiple modalities for accessibility
   - Person-centered profiles

## 🔬 Research Methodology
